    <h1>Avidbots</h1>
    <p>At Avidbots, I wrote the software framework for two large-scale commercial floor-cleaning robots.  This framework includes components for motion planning, communication, visualization, live view, and control.  The motion planner encompasses the  most complexity, containing a complete coverage planning algorithm, dynamic and static constraints, and dynamic obstacle avoidance.  Avidbots was a 2014 Haxlr8r incubator participant, a 2014 Robot Launch semifinalist, has raised multiple rounds, and has over 80 employees.</p>

    <h1>PR2</h1>
    <p>At Willow Garage, I improved the arm navigation stack by gathering statistics for comparing motion-planning algorithms; creating a very fast time parametrization algorithm that enforces dynamic constraints (velocity and acceleration) on a given trajectory; and improving distance field calculations by using incremental updates.  The filter and incremental updates improved the speed of the existing components by 100-fold and 30-fold, respectively.  This work is now a key component in the trajectory planning portion of the  open source ROS (Robot Operating System) and MoveIt library, which is used by over 65 robots.</p>

    <h1>Space Station Remote Manipulator System</h1>
    <p>At Queen's University, I worked in the Robotics and Computer Vision Laboratory under the supervision of Dr. Michael Greenspan.  I implemented Greenspan's patented collision detection algorithm and visualization system for use with MD Robotics' SSRMS (aka. Canadarm2&reg;).  This technique used specialized representations of objects (spheres and voxels) in order to perform real-time collision detection on an embedded system.  Results were published Symposium on Robot Design, Dynamics and Control, 2004.</p>

    <h1>Deep Green</h1>
    <p>At Queen's, the majority of my time was spent on Deep Green&trade;, a robot designed to play pool. I was involved in multiple aspects of the project.  I used image processing techniques to localize the pool balls on the surface of the table.  I implemented lighting strategies to minimize shadows affecting the computer vision.  I investigated a new calibration technique for a local, cue-mounted camera.  Additionally, I developed a simulated environment to test out my AI shot strategies.  We were featured on the the Discovery Channel, Slashdot, and YouTube.</p>

    <h1>Kato</h1>
    <p>At the University of Alberta, I again had an opportunity to work on a robotics research project. This time our team modified Kato&trade;, a robotic Segway, to geocache in a park (navigate from one GPS location to another). My particular task involved accessing the drivability of terrain, which I determined through structured crash-tests. Our final field test was shown again on the Discovery Channel and the Edmonton Journal.</p>
