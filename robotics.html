    <h2>Avidbots</h2>
    <div class="sectionbody">
    <div class="paragraph"><p>At Avidbots, I wrote the software framework for two large-scale commercial floor-cleaning robots.  This framework includes components for motion planning, communication, visualization, live view, and control.  The motion planner encompasses the  most complexity, containing a complete coverage planning algorithm, dynamic and static constraints, and dynamic obstacle avoidance.  Avidbots was a 2014 Haxlr8r incubator participant, a 2014 Robot Launch semifinalist, has raised multiple rounds, and has over 80 employees.</p></div>

    <h2>PR2</h2>
    <div class="sectionbody">
    <div class="paragraph"><p>At Willow Garage, I improved the arm navigation stack by gathering statistics for comparing motion-planning algorithms; creating a very fast time parametrization algorithm that enforces dynamic constraints (velocity and acceleration) on a given trajectory; and improving distance field calculations by using incremental updates.  The filter and incremental updates improved the speed of the existing components by 100-fold and 30-fold, respectively.  This work is now a key component in the trajectory planning portion of the  open source ROS (Robot Operating System) and MoveIt library, which is used by over 65 robots.</p></div>

    <h2>Space Station Remote Manipulator System</h2>
    <div class="sectionbody">
    <div class="paragraph"><p>At Queen&#8217;s University, I worked in the Robotics and Computer Vision Laboratory under the supervision of Dr. Michael Greenspan.  I implemented Greenspan&#8217;s patented collision detection algorithm and visualization system for use with MD Robotics' SSRMS (aka. Canadarm2&#174;).  This technique used specialized representations of objects (spheres and voxels) in order to perform real-time collision detection on an embedded system.  Results were published Symposium on Robot Design, Dynamics and Control, 2004.</p></div>

    <h2>Deep Green</h2>
    <div class="sectionbody">
    <div class="paragraph"><p>At Queen&#8217;s, the majority of my time was spent on Deep Green&#8482;, a robot designed to play pool. I was involved in multiple aspects of the project.  I used image processing techniques to localize the pool balls on the surface of the table.  I implemented lighting strategies to minimize shadows affecting the computer vision.  I investigated a new calibration technique for a local, cue-mounted camera.  Additionally, I developed a simulated environment to test out my AI shot strategies.  We were featured on the the Discovery Channel, Slashdot, and YouTube.</p></div>

    <h2>Kato</h2>
    <div class="sectionbody">
    <div class="paragraph"><p>At the University of Alberta, I again had an opportunity to work on a robotics research project. This time our team modified Kato&#8482;, a robotic Segway, to geocache in a park (navigate from one GPS location to another). My particular task involved accessing the drivability of terrain, which I determined through structured crash-tests. Our final field test was shown again on the Discovery Channel and the Edmonton Journal.</p></div>
