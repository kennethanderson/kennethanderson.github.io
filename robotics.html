    <p>I cofounded Avidbots in 2014.  I wrote the software framework for two large-scale commercial floor-cleaning robots.  This framework includes components for motion planning, communication, visualization, live view, and control.  The motion planner encompasses the  most complexity, containing a complete coverage planning algorithm, dynamic and static constraints, and dynamic obstacle avoidance.  Avidbots was a 2014 Haxlr8r incubator participant, a 2014 Robot Launch semifinalist, has raised multiple rounds, and has over 80 employees.</p>

    <div>
    <p>I improved the arm navigation stack by gathering statistics for comparing motion-planning algorithms; creating a very fast time parametrization algorithm that enforces dynamic constraints (velocity and acceleration) on a given trajectory; and improving distance field calculations by using incremental updates.  The filter and incremental updates improved the speed of the existing components by 100-fold and 30-fold, respectively.  This work is now a key component in the trajectory planning portion of the  open source ROS (Robot Operating System) and MoveIt library, which is used by over 65 robots.</p>

    <p>I worked in the Robotics and Computer Vision Laboratory under the supervision of Dr. Michael Greenspan.  I implemented Greenspan&rsquo;s patented collision detection algorithm and visualization system for use with MD Robotics' SSRMS (aka. Canadarm2&reg;).  This technique used specialized representations of objects (spheres and voxels) in order to perform real-time collision detection on an embedded system.  Results were published Symposium on Robot Design, Dynamics and Control, 2004.</p>

    <div>
    <p>I worked on multiple aspects of the robotic pool-playing robot Deep Green&trade;.  I used image processing techniques to localize the pool balls on the surface of the table.  I implemented lighting strategies to minimize shadows affecting the computer vision.  I investigated a new calibration technique for a local, cue-mounted camera.  Additionally, I developed a simulated environment to test out my AI shot strategies.  We were featured on the the Discovery Channel, Slashdot, and YouTube.</p>

    <p>Our team modified Kato&trade;, a robotic Segway, to geocache (navigate from one GPS location to another). I taught the robot to access terrain drivability through a series of structured crash-tests. Our final field test was shown again on the Discovery Channel and the Edmonton Journal.</p>
