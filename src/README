Dependencies:
- asciidoc

Asciidoc allows me to write entire html pages in simple syntax, 
which can be converted directly to styled html.
Some other good things about asciidoc--
- asciidoc has a single standard, and is extensible.
- asciidoc can convert to multiple output types.
- asciidoc has syntax highlighting in vim.
- asciidoc converts bullet/numbered lists, (R)(TM)(C), arrows by default.
- asciidoc is recommended by Linus Torvalds and Eric Raymond.

On the downside-- 
- asciidoc is more complicated and requires bigger installation package(s).
- asciidoc implementation is in Python.
  asciidoctor implementation is in Ruby. (which is ~25x faster... actually).

Some other options:

Markdown--
- markdown is only converted outside block elements, doesn't handle tables, etc.
  The block element is a big problem, it would force me to split every section (with a header)
  then recombine them all!  Leading to serious file proliferation.
- markdown has multiple 'flavours' to deal with some of these deficiencies.  
  But then you have to choose a standard and cross your fingers.

awk + template--
- a variety of special cases that other templating engines would handle more simply.
+ but it is already on most linux systems.

Or json + mustache--
- json may be overkill.
- Quotes and special characters require hand-editing.
